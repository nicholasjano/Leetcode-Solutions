# Solution Walk Through
Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-salary/

## Intuition
Pretty simple question, but it differentiates from the others as I must use update instead of select. I can easily use "update" and "set" to replicate "from" and "select."

## Approach
- Choose to update the Salary table
- Use a case to flip sex from "m" to "f" or vice versa
